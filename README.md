A rudimentary exercise system which provides a step-by-step guide for executing the knee-bend exercise properly. 

The system utilises [mediapipe](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/) library to identify the body landmarks and overall position of body parts.

Includes a start counter, timer and rep-counter

Depeding on the lower body angle the model calculates, it identifies the correct posture. The system and timer pauses if the required angle drops below a threshold
